			<h2> The last few years have been very different --to say the least. A new virus was introduced to the world known as COVID-19, and the world spiraled into a pandemic. This communicable disease was spreading like wildfire and took the lives of many people. The world changed in many ways, because of this virus. People started wearing masks, schools started to function virtually, events started to take place virtually, etc; but most importantly it had become one of the leading causes of death. In most cases, COVID-19 is not deadly; but when a patient has underlying health conditions, it can be lethal. COVID-19 amplifies cardiovascular diseasesâ€™ seriousness a lot which is why our team, Data Innovate decided to focus on the treatment and detection of Cardiovascular diseases.  </h2>
