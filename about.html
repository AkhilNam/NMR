			What is NMR:
		</h2>
			<h3 class="text-block">
				NMR, also known as Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, is a phenomenon which allows the molecular structure of a substance
				 to be analyzed by observing the nuclear spin, the nuclear magnetic moments, when placed in a powerful magnetic field.

			<h2 class="green2">Who discovered NMR:</h2>
			<h3 class="text-block2">
				Sometime in the 1930s, Isidor Rabi discovered NMR. He received a Nobel Prize for his work. He and his team were experimenting with the magnetic properties of the nuclei of atoms, which led to him discovering how they can change their magnetic orientations by an external magnetic field. This phenomenon was the core discovery of NMR.
